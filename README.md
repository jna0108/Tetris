# Tetris

My crude attempt at familiarizing myself with SDL by recreating the famous game Tetris. It successfully runs a barebones version of the game.

Notes:

I didn't realize until much later (when I tried to make the game prettier by adding textures) that I messed up the SDL version and the dependencies at the very beginning of the project. I plan on making a new version in the undefined future that has the libraries set up properly so that I can add textures, along with a few other nifty parts of the game. Lots of mistakes in this one, but it was a great first attempt at getting into graphics.
